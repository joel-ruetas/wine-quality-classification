This study focuses on evaluating red wine quality through the analysis of its physicochemical properties. The primary objective is to differentiate between high and low-quality red wines using a binary classification model. This approach is rooted in the understanding that wine quality, traditionally assessed through human sensory analysis or the examination of physicochemical properties, can benefit from more objective and efficient methods like machine learning.

Key physicochemical properties such as pH, dissolved salts, sodium content, acidity, and density are known to significantly influence wine quality. The study utilizes the red wine quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to conduct this analysis. This innovative method aims to provide a more systematic and less subjective assessment of red wine quality, responding to the growing market demand for high-quality wines and more reliable quality prediction methods.

Giardina in VineRoutes Wine Magazine, discussing wine rating systems and quality-to-price-ratio analysis. This study represents a significant step in wine informatics, leveraging advanced data analysis to enhance the traditional wine quality evaluation process.
